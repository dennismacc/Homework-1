# Homework-1

## Refactor existing code so that it is more optimized for SEO and web accessibility as well as being more organized and concise. 

## The existing source code was not written in a matter that is optimized for search engines and lacked necessary features to make it web accessible for individuals with disabilities. In addition to this, semantic HTML elements were not used and the overall source code lacked organization, detail, and precision. In building the project the goal was address the above mentioned problems to optimize the webpage for the client and the users who would be interacting with the end product. This goal was accomplished in three parts. First, semantic HTML elements were added to the source code by removing <div> tags and replacing them with more specific and concise tags, which also served to improve the SEO features of the webpage. Next, <alt> descriptor tags were added to each <img> in order to provide accessibility to diverse users. Lastly, tags within the source code were edited to make them more descriptive and concise, to make it easier for future developers to edit and rework the code, and made it easier to follow. From this I was able to learn how to write more clear and concise HTML and CSS source code for a webpage, and optimize the webpage for search engines and provide accessibility.
